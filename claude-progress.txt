## Task Description
Fix 3 remaining differences between Rust zsign and C++ zsign to achieve byte-level parity for iOS app signing. Current issues:
1. requirements_size: C++ 188 bytes vs Rust 12 bytes  
2. exec_seg_flags: C++ 0x11 vs Rust 0x1
3. cms_signature_size: C++ 4844 bytes vs Rust 2519 bytes

Reference: docs/plans/2024-12-28-cpp-parity-fixes.md contains detailed implementation steps.
C++ zsign source: ~/workspace/projects/zsign

## Feature Status
🔄 [IN_PROGRESS] feature-1: Task 1: Wire up full requirements blob - In signer.rs, call build_requirements_blob_full(identifier, subject_cn) instead of build_requirements_blob(). Add helper function extract_subject_cn(cert) usin

🔄 [IN_PROGRESS] feature-3: Task 3: Fix CMS signature - Pass certificate stack to CMS_sign() - In cms.rs, build STACK_OF(X509) with Apple WWDR + Root CA certificates and pass to CMS_sign() instead of null pointer. Add FFI declar
